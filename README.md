This Telegram bot shows you words or phrases, suggesting that you translate them yourself. Afterwards, you can check yourself by opening the correct answer. Each word/phrase has its own weighting coefficient. Every time you press the "Know" button, you decrease the weight of the word, and it will appear less frequently. If you press "Don't know," you increase the weight of the word, and it will appear more often, helping you to better memorize it.

If you want to run this bot on your PC, you need to obtain a Telegram Bot token. You can do this by using TelegramBotFather.
